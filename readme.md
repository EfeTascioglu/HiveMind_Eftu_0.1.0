Take control of the Biters, defend your home planet from the foreign invaders, The Engineers. Build Spawners and influence a pollution based economy, and lead yourself to Victory!

#### Changelog:
Commit 4:
- Fixed the "update_lab" function to now consume pollution with a minimum of 1, with no overflow or waste of pollution. Labs can now activate earlier and work in smaller increments. Also added a debug mode, and fixed the starting popcap settings to start with popcap increase tech level 0.
